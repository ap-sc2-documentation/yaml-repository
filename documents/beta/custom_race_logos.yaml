# This creates one campaign for each race that takes the shape of the respective race's logo
# As with all custom mission orders, this requires setting "mission_order: custom" in your YAML to work.
# To play with less than all of the races, remove that race's respective campaign from the custom mission order.
# To have enough missions of each faction, it's also necessary to have race-swaps enabled.

# Contains:
# terran missions: 29
# protoss missions: 30
# zerg missions: 24
